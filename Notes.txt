Arduino LED Controller

Power: 0v - 15v 
What it powers, Arduino, 3x 5v buck converters, 1 white 60" led strip  
Input1: 1 voltage divier circuit that divides automotive level voltage 11 times: 1-1Mohm and 1-100kohm resistors
Expected input ranges: 0v to 15v
Expected divided voltage: 0v ,12v = 1.091v ,15v = 1.364v
Input2: 1 voltage divier circuit that divides automotive level voltage 11 times: 1-1Mohm and 1-100kohm resistors
Expected input ranges: 0v to 15v
Expected divided voltage: 0v ,12v = 1.091v ,15v = 1.364v

voltage divider
DRL -> 1M -> sense pin -> 47k -> ground

 pseudo code
Buf = 1 //+-1v
Div = 50 / 1000 //divider value
LBL = 2 //2v low beam
DRL = 12 //12v DRL 
Brightness = in / Div
If abs(brightness - LBL) < Buf then lowBeam=true
Also, to set led brightness
LEDv = brightness * 256 / 12
If LEDv > 256 then LEDv =256
If LEDv < 0 then LEDv =0c ch
